  <p><strong>3. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY; CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></p>
  <p>3.1 Subject to the express permissions of these Terms, You and Hackraise will protect each others Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to these Terms, each of us may use each others Confidential Information solely to exercise our respective rights and perform our respective obligations under these Terms and shall disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of our respective employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information.

  <p>3.2 Hackraise will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your Data. These safeguards include encryption of Your Data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through Service at Your election. Our compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.2 shall be deemed compliance with Our obligations to protect Your Data as set forth in Section 3.1.</p>
  <p>3.3 You agree that Hackraise and the service providers We use to assist in providing the Service to You shall have the right to access Your Account and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Your Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Service, including, without limitation, in response to Your support requests. Any third party service providers We utilize will only be given access to Your Account and Your Data as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service and will be subject to confidentiality obligations.</p>

  <p>To the extent Hackraise Processes any Personal Data on Your behalf in connection with use of the Service by You, Your Agents and/or End-Users, Hackraise and You hereby agree that You shall be deemed to be the data controller and Hackraise shall be deemed to be the data processor as those terms are understood under the Directive (and any applicable national legislation implementing the Directive).

  <p>Your Data is currently hosted by Hackraise or its authorized service partners in data centers located in the United States or the European Economic Area. If Your principal location is within the European Economic Area or the United States, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify You at least thirty (30) days before our election to host Personal Data provided to Hackraise in connection with use of the Service in data centers located outside the European Economic Area or the United States. If You are entitled to this notice and do not wish to have Your Personal Data hosted in data centers located in such other country or territory, You may terminate Your Subscription and Your Account with immediate effect upon written notice to Hackraise within 30 days or Your receipt of such notice. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not, in any event, be deemed to limit any other manner of Processing of such Personal Data within the Hackraise Group or to authorized service providers whether in the European Economic Area, the United States or elsewhere.</p>
  <p><strong>4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong></p>
  <p>Each of us shall maintain all rights, title and interest in and to all our respective patents, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights (collectively, Intellectual Property Rights).

  <p>6.5 If You pay by credit card, the Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by Hackraise, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status. You hereby authorize Hackraise to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan until you terminate your Subscription, and you further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. Hackraise uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Hackraise.</p>
  <p><strong>7. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
  <p>7.1 Either You or Hackraise may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to the Service as of the end of your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with these Terms, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to the Service is so terminated, Your subscription to the Service will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan to which You have subscribed as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.</p>
  <p>7.2 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term. Following the termination or cancellation of Your subscription to the Service and/or Account, We reserve the right to delete all Your Data in the normal course of operation. Your Data cannot be recovered once Your Account is cancelled.</p>
  <p>7.3 If You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Section 2.5(c) or 7.4, in addition to other amounts You may owe Hackraise, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term. This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of these Terms by Hackraise, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to Hackraise and afford Hackraise not less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach.</p>
  <p>7.4 Hackraise reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Agents or End Users rights to access and use the Service, and remove, disable and discard any of Your Data if We believe that You, Agents or End Users have violated these Terms. This includes the removal or disablement of Your Data. Unless legally prohibited from doing so, Hackraise will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions. Hackraise shall not be liable to You, Agents, End Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Agents or End Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion.</p>
  <p><strong>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong></p>
  <p>THE SITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND HELPFUL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HELPFUL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM HELPFUL OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>
  <p><strong>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></p>
  <p>9.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
  <p>9.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, HELPFULS AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF HELPFUL WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. HELPFUL HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS.</p>
  <p>9.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, HELPFULS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
  <p><strong>10. INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>
  <p>10.1 Hackraise will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third partys valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an IP Claim). Hackraise shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Hackraise for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Hackraise of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Hackraise will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) You fully cooperate with Hackraise in connection therewith. If use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users has become, or in Hackraises opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Hackraise may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Hackraise, terminate Your subscription to the Service and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Hackraise for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Hackraise will have no liability or obligation under this Section 11.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Hackraise; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing.</p>
  <p>The provisions of this Section 11.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Hackraise to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users.</p>
  <p>10.2 You will indemnify and hold Hackraise harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Hackraise arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Hackraise promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim.</p>
  <p><strong>11. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS</strong></p>
  <p>11.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Hackraises prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Hackraise Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of Hackraise or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Hackraise offers through the Service (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, We will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent designated as an administrator on your Account activates the feature or functionality. Where theres a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. </p>
  <p>11.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Hackraise as Your consent to any such amendment. Hackraises failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms.</p>
  <p><strong>12. SEVERABILITY</strong></p>
  <p>If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect.</p>
